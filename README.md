# Handwritten Digit Recognition using Generative Adversarial Network
**This project aims to recognize handwritten digits utilizing the power of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). GANs are a class of machine learning algorithms used for unsupervised learning introduced by Ian Goodfellow and his colleagues in 2014.**

# Project Overview
**Handwritten digit recognition is a foundational problem in the field of machine learning and computer vision. The goal is to accurately classify and identify handwritten digits (0-9) from various sources. In this project, we leverage GANs to generate synthetic handwritten digits and subsequently train a classifier to recognize them.**
